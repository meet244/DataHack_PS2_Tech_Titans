[![Web Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗-HuggingFace%20Space-cyan.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/meet244/Legal-Up_Lawyer_Recommendation_System)

## Overview 🚀
Welcome to Legal Up, your trusted companion for finding the right lawyer! This project is designed to recommend suitable lawyers to clients based on a concise description of their case, typically within 40-50 words. Our system leverages natural language processing and advanced matching algorithms to understand client requirements and connect them with lawyers possessing the relevant skills and expertise to provide tailored legal solutions.

## Project Structure 🏗️
- **Did Not Work Folder 📂**: This folder contains a previous attempt at the project, which utilized vector table databases. This approach was unsuccessful due to the team's inexperience with such databases.

- **API Folder 🌐**: Inside this folder, you will find the `index.py` file, which serves as the main server for the backend of the application. This is where the core functionality of the Legal Up lawyer recommendation system resides.

- **Frontend Folder 💻**: The frontend of the application is stored in this folder. It includes all the React components and necessary files for the user interface.

## Key Features 🌟
1. **Client Query Analysis 📝**: Legal Up utilizes machine learning models to extract essential features from the client's query, enabling a deeper understanding of their legal requirements.

2. **Recommendation Engine 🧲**: The system includes a recommendation code that matches clients with the most suitable lawyers based on the extracted features and the lawyers' expertise.
